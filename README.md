# fedelemflowlist

`fedelemflowlist` is a Python package that generates and provides a standardized elementary flow list for use in life cycle assessment (LCA) data
 as well as mappings to convert data from other sources. This list supports the [Federal LCA Commons](http://www.lcacommons.gov),
 where preferred flows from the active version of the flow list produced by this package can be found in formats for use in LCA software.
 
 ZZZZ

 Standard formats for a [Flow List](./format%20specs/FlowList.md)
 and a [Flow Mapping](./format%20specs/FlowMapping.md) are defined and provided by `fedelemflowlist`.
  They are implemented as [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) dataframes.
   Standard formats are also described for the input files used in building the flow list, and implemented as .csv files
   in the [input](https://github.com/USEPA/Federal-LCA-Commons-Elementary-Flow-List/tree/master/fedelemflowlist/input) directory.  

 The version of the package (see [Releases](https://github.com/USEPA/Federal-LCA-Commons-Elementary-Flow-List/releases/))
 corresponds to the version of the flow list that it provides. The complete or 'master' list contains all valid flows,
  where the 'preferred' flows are the recommended flows for use in LCA data.
  
`fedelemflowlist` can export complete or subsets of the flow list and mapping files as a .zip archive of [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/)
 files conforming to the [openLCA schema](http://greendelta.github.io/olca-schema/).

 The background and methodology behind creation of the flow list, as well as a summary of the flow list itself can be
  found in the USEPA Report
 ['The Federal LCA Commons Elementary Flow List: Background, Approach, Description and Recommendations for Use'](https://cfpub.epa.gov/si/si_public_search_results.cfm?simpleSearch=0&showCriteria=2&searchAll=elementary+flows&TIMSType=Published+Report&dateBeginPublishedPresented=07%2F31%2F2019). Definitions for terms used in the flow list can be found in on EPA's Terminology Services in the [Federal LCA Commons Elementary Flow List for Life Cycle Assessment vocabulary](https://sor.epa.gov/sor_internet/registry/termreg/searchandretrieve/glossariesandkeywordlists/search.do?details=&vocabName=FEDEFL). 

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/USEPA/Federal-LCA-Commons-Elementary-Flow-List/wiki/) for installation, more info on repository
contents, use examples, and for instructions on how to contribute to the flow list through additions or edits to flows or flow mappings.
